#  AI Real-time GYM Coach
 
An AI-powered gym coaching web app that uses your camera to detect exercise form in real time, counts reps and sets, and delivers live voice feedback via an LLM-powered coach.
 
**Live Demo:** [personal-ai-gym-coach.streamlit.app](https://personal-ai-gym-coach.streamlit.app)

## Features
 
- **Real-time pose detection** using MediaPipe via webcam
- **5 supported exercises:** Squats, Push-ups, Bicep Curls, Shoulder Press, Lunges
- **Automatic rep and set counting** with per-exercise form metrics
- **AI voice coaching** powered by Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B) and gTTS — speaks corrections and motivation aloud
- **Form analysis** with exercise-specific feedback (e.g. knee angle, back arch, hip position)
- **Workout history** stored locally in SQLite and displayed per session
- **User login** via unique username — no password required
- **CI pipeline** via GitHub Actions (linting on every push)

## Running Locally
 
**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashharkhan10/ai-gym-coach
cd ai-gym-coach
```
 
**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
**3. Add your Groq API key**
 
Create a `.env` file in the root:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
 
Or add it to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
```
 
**4. Run the app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
 
---
 
## Deployment
 
Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** with auto-redeploy on every push to `main`.
 
The `GROQ_API_KEY` is stored in Streamlit Cloud's secrets manager.
 
System dependencies (OpenCV, MediaPipe) are declared in `packages.txt`.
 
---
 
## CI/CD
 
GitHub Actions runs on every push and pull request to `main`:
- Lints the codebase using `ruff`
- Fails the pipeline if any unused variables or import errors are found
